# Adventure-Works-Report


### 1. Project 

An executive Power BI dashboard solution developed to explore sales, product orders, returns, and revenue trends across categories and regions. Built using Microsoft's Adventure Works dataset, this dashboard is designed for quick, visual insights into business performance.

### 2. Description / Purpose

The Adventure Works Dashboard is an interactive report developed to track total revenue, sales orders, product return rates, and profitability across product types and geographies. It provides business managers with a consolidated view of KPIs and product-level insights for data-driven decisions.
 

### 3. Tech Stack 
 
This project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for building the dashboard and visualizations

📂 Power Query – Used for importing, cleaning, and transforming data

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for dynamic measures and KPIs

🧱 Data Modeling – Relationships established among fact and dimension tables

📑 Microsoft Excel (.csv) – Used as the initial data review and preprocessing tool

📁 File Format – .pbix file for the Power BI dashboard


### 4.  Business Problem

Adventure Works' leadership needs a visual and analytical way to assess their sales data across regions, products, and customer segments. Static reports are insufficient for driving business strategy and optimizing sales efforts.

### 5. Goal of the Dashboard

To provide a centralized reporting tool that:

Tracks monthly KPIs for revenue, orders, and returns

Highlights product-wise performance and return rates

Provides a regional view of sales contribution

Helps identify sales trends and performance forecasts over time
